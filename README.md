# Boardgames_catalogue

This is meant as an (yet another) exercise - a REST boardgames catalogue. 

Aim: to show, add, change, and delete entries in my boardgames database.

Option to search db by the number of players (e.g. if there's me and my two friends, which of my 400 boardgames can we play).

Does not work (yet), but the "showAllGames.php" function works nicely.

PS. Of course there's an ignored "connect.php" file that stores connection data (username, password, db name, etc.)
